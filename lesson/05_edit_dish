# Functional description

I would like to review all dishes, and edit a single dish.

# Technical description

- Create a new branch to implement this feature.
- Add support for GET requests in `dishes/{dishId}` endpoint on the server side and read the Dish from the database using the `dishId` in the request.
- Add support for PUT requests in `dishes/{dishId}` endpoint on the server side and update the Dish identified by the `dishId` in the request. The same validation should be applied than in the Create Dish POST request.
- Create a new Edit Dish page to edit a Dish under `/dishes/{dishId}`. This page should reuse the existing Dish form to edit a dish. Use the `dishId` in the url to load But this time, instead of creating a new one, should update the Dish.
- Change the Dishes page that currently has the Create Dish form, to display a list of all Dishes.
- For each Dish in the list it should display the Dish name and an Edit button. When clicking the button, there should be a redirect to `/dishes/{dishId}`, the Edit Dish page.
- Move the Create Dish page to a new page under `/dishes/add`.
- Submit a merge request and pass code review.
