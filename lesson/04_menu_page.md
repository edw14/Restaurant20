# Functional description

On the Menu page I can browse the restaurant dishes by category.

# Technical description

- Create a new branch to implement this feature.
- Create a new `dishes` endpoint to return a list of dishes from the database. It should respond to a GET request.
- Create a new Menu page with a page title.
- Create a new Component to display a single Dish. Use semantic HTML. The component should display the Dish name and the price in first line separated by `â€“` in between them. The second line should contain the description.
  ```tsx
  export default function MenuDish({ dish }) {}
  ```
- Create a new Component to display a Dish category. It should display the category name and a list of Dishes. Display the Dishes using the `MenuDish` component.
  ```tsx
  export default function MenuCategory({ categoryName, dishes }) {}
  ```
- Call the `dishes` endpoint on the frontend side.
- Sort the received Dish list by category.
- Create a two-dimensional array from the sorted Dish list, so that each category would be an array of Dishes in the primary array.
- Display the Menu by iterating over the two-dimensional array using the `MenuCategory` component.
- Create a unit test for the MenuDish component.
- Submit a merge request and pass code review.
